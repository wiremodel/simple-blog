## Custom table column with inline action

![Custom table column with inline action](./screenshots/custom-column-action.png)

Sometimes, you need to trigger custom actions directly from a Filament [table column](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/tables/columns/overview). Filament supports this natively, and you can use [Action modals](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/tables/columns/overview#action-modals) to display a form inside a modal, for example.
